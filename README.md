# Design and Implementation of a Real-Time ECG Monitoring System using Diligent analog Discovery Board and LabVIEW (Major-Project-II)
Final Year Project
## 
This Project is a cost-effective and accessible DIY Electrocardiogram (ECG) system using the Analog Discovery Studio and
LabVIEW. The ECG signal, representing the heartâ€™s electrical activity, is amplified through external circuitry and processed in LabVIEW via WaveForms Virtual Instruments (VIs).
These VIs enable filtering, peak detection, and heart rate calculation. The system offers a
customizable solution for ECG acquisition, processing, and analysis, promoting hands-on
learning and experimentation in biomedical instrumentation and signal processing. This
project highlights the potential of utilizing accessible hardware and software tools for
practical healthcare technology applications
